# My Dotfiles

This directory contains my system dotfiles for my Debian (Kali) configuration

## Requirements

I really need to test this out, but I think the following things are required:

- Alacritty
- fzf
- JetBrainsMono Nerd Font
- Stow

## Usage
```
git clone <this_repo>
cd dotfiles
stow --adopt .
```
